# Intune-Deployment-Tool
This tool is made to speed up the packaging process of Win32 applications within Intune.

As some of you may have noticed, Adobe hasn't exactly made it easier to deploy Acrobat applications as a win32 application in Microsoft Intune.  The purpose of this repository is to make it easier for others to deploy Adobe Reader apps in Microsoft Intune.
